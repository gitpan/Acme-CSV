I have been using this CSV module for years, whenever someone comes to
me with a spreadsheet for munging. I can't remember where I even found
it originally, but it has a simple interface and works well. I've been
frustrated by this module not being on CPAN on several occasions, so
with the original author's blessing, I am making it available there.

This module was not originally in the Acme namespace, but I am moving
it there to avoid controversy, and because it seems somewhat appropriate
given the 1,000,000 other CSV modules which are already on CPAN.

See Acme::CSV for perldoc and copyright info.
